# ABSTRACT
As the music consumption paradigm moves towards  streaming services, users have access to increasingly large catalogs of music. In this scenario, music classification plays an important role in music discovery. It  enables, for example,  search by genres or automatic playlist creation based on mood. In this work we study the classification of song mood, using features extracted from lyrics alone, based on a vector space model representation. Previous work in this area reached contradictory conclusions based on experiments carried out using different datasets and evaluation methodologies. In contrast, we use a large freely-available dataset to compare the performance of different term-weighting approaches from a classification perspective. The experiments we present show that lyrics can successfully be used to classify music mood, achieving accuracies of up to 70\% in some cases. Moreover, contrary to other work, we show that the performance of the different term weighting approaches evaluated is not  statistically different using the dataset considered. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the dataset used in this work, and the need for a new benchmark dataset to progress  work in this area.
